;;;; Mutation testing (cl-weave:run-mutations) applied to small, pure
;;;; arithmetic/conditional formulas lifted verbatim from the runtime, as a
;;;; second line of defense beyond example- and property-based tests: it
;;;; proves the reference computation used by those tests is itself sharp
;;;; enough to distinguish every arithmetic-operator, comparison-operator,
;;;; boolean-literal, and if-branch mutant cl-weave can generate, not just
;;;; agree with the original on the cases already exercised.
