# Security Policy

`cl-dataflow` is a small Common Lisp library, but any bug that causes incorrect
graph execution, state corruption, or unsafe effect handling should be treated
seriously.

## Supported versions

The library is pre-1.0, so only the latest released version and `main` receive
security fixes. Upgrade to the newest tag before reporting an issue.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| 0.1.x   | Yes |
| < 0.1.0 | No  |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately using GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting:

1. Open <https://github.com/takeokunn/cl-dataflow/security/advisories/new>.
2. Or go to the repository's **Security** tab and choose **Report a vulnerability**.

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Include:

- What you observed
- The affected file or API
- A minimal reproduction if possible
- Whether the issue affects runtime behavior, data integrity, or availability

## What to avoid in public reports

- Full exploit details before maintainers have a chance to respond
- Sensitive data or secrets
- Unnecessary public proof-of-concept material

## Expected response

Maintainers aim to acknowledge a report within a few days, validate the impact,
and coordinate a fix or mitigation before public disclosure where possible. Once
a fix ships, the advisory is published with credit to the reporter unless
anonymity is requested.
