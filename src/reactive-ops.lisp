;;;; Stateful and combining operators over reactive subjects, bringing the
;;;; push-based side toward parity with the pull-based stream operators. Each

;;;; per-operator state lives in the closure. Everything is synchronous, so an
;;;; emission propagates through the whole derived graph before EMIT returns.
