;;;; Rendering and serialisation for graphs. Every renderer walks a deterministic
;;;; snapshot -- nodes name-sorted, edges sorted by their endpoints and ports -- so
;;;; the output of GRAPH->DOT / GRAPH->MERMAID / GRAPH-TO-PLIST is stable across
;;;; runs and safe to diff or golden-test.

;;; Rendering order is fixed by decorating each item with a single NUL-joined
;;; string key and sorting under STRING<. This gives a stable total order without
;;; a hand-written multi-key comparator, whose string>/all-equal branches are
;;; unreachable when the items (edges, transitions) are already pairwise distinct.
