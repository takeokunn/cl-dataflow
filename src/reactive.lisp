;;;; Synchronous push-based reactive subjects -- the producer-driven dual of the
;;;; consumer-driven FLOW-STREAM. A SUBJECT holds an ordered list of subscriber
;;;; functions; SUBJECT-EMIT pushes a value to each of them, immediately and in
;;;; subscription order (no threads, fully deterministic). Derived subjects
;;;; (map/filter/merge) subscribe to their sources and re-emit, so a small reactive
;;;; graph can be wired up for event-driven workflows. The SUBJECT type is opaque;
;;;; use SUBJECT-P and the operators below.
