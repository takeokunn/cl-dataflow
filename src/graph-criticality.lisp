;;;; Critical-node and critical-connection analysis over the undirected view of a
;;;; graph: articulation points (cut vertices) and bridges (cut connections) --

;;;; recursion-free way: remove the element and recount weakly connected
;;;; components. This is O(V*(V+E)) / O(E*(V+E)) -- linear traversals over the
;;;; whole graph per candidate -- but never grows the control stack, matching the
;;;; library's deep-graph guarantees, and correctly handles multigraphs.
