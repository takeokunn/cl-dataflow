;;;; Graph mutation and composition. The base graph API is append-only (ADD-NODE /
;;;; ADD-EDGE); these fill in removal, induced subgraphs, disjoint merge, and node
;;;; relabelling. In-place removals mutate GRAPH and mirror the add-* return
;;;; conventions; the derivations (subgraph, merge, relabel) return fresh graphs
;;;; and never alter their inputs.
