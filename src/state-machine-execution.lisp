;;;; Execution-oriented state-machine helpers layered on the core runtime
;;;; (STEP-STATE-MACHINE) and the analysis layer. STATE-MACHINE-RUN-STATES and
;;;; STATE-MACHINE-ACCEPTS-P interpret an event sequence and inherit the runtime's
;;;; exact guard/transition semantics; STATE-MACHINE-EVENT-PATH is the event-level
;;;; analog of GRAPH-PATH, searching for the events that connect two states.
